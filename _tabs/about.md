## Who, When, Why

I am Mathijs van Rijn. Studied electrical engineering with a focus on PCB design.

I made this website when transitioning to becomming a software engineer at CODAM.

I always want to document everything I learn, and doing it this way could be a good recource for my future self or others. And it is a fun way to learn a bit about website design.
