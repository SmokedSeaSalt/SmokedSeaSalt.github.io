## FdF
This will just be a thought collection or code snippet storage. Not a detailed walkthrough or example of ft_printf.

This project involves creating a simple wireframe
model of a landscape.

## Overview
This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges).

## Rendering
Your program has to represent the model in isometric projection. The coordinates of the landscape are stored in a .fdf file, provided as a command line parameter to your program. Here is an example:

```text
$>cat 42.fdf
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0 10 10  0  0 10 10  0  0  0 10 10 10 10 10  0  0  0
0  0 10 10  0  0 10 10  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 10 10  0  0
0  0 10 10  0  0 10 10  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 10 10  0  0
0  0 10 10 10 10 10 10  0  0  0  0 10 10 10 10  0  0  0
0  0  0 10 10 10 10 10  0  0  0 10 10  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0 10 10  0  0  0 10 10  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0 10 10  0  0  0 10 10 10 10 10 10  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
$>
```

this should result in something like this:
![FdF example](/assets/img/fdf/FdF_example.png){: w="900" h="720" }

## Graphic management

Your program has to display the image in a window.
- Window management must remain smooth (e.g., switching to another window, minimizing, etc.).
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- Clicking on the cross on the windowâ€™s frame must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- The use of the images of the MiniLibX library is mandatory
