## Tried it for a month
So I tried it for a month. Started with using the vim extension in vscode and later moved on to neovim. But it isn't for me. My mind does not work in the motion way. I already have difficulty getting normal system/vscode shortcuts to be musclememmory, so for now this dream is on hold. I still want to get into it some day, but not today.

## Start of the neovim journey

[kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
A basic init.lua file with lots of comments explaining stuff.
Good introduction to plugins.
Has some extra nice shortcuts.

[VSCode learn vim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vintharas.learn-vim)
good introduction to learn vim motions and the possibilities of vim. With tutorial page and practice file next to each other.

[Basic tutorial](https://bread-man88.github.io/blog/programming/2025/03/14/simple-nvim-config.html)
A neovim config in <50 lines. Concise startup guide with some basic explanation.

[More complex tutorial](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch)
The config that inspired lunarvim. Has less explanation but a lot of examples with video's.

[Learn Neovim the practical way](https://alpha2phi.medium.com/learn-neovim-the-practical-way-8818fcf4830f)
Very comprehensive tutorial. All the pages are paywall blocked but you can read the intro paragraph and search the internet for explanation about that thing.

### Options for neovim launcher

pro's
  - maintained
  - lots of instant plugins
  - premade nice colour schemes
  - premade nice shortcuts

cons
  - also need to learn how launcher works

  - can be more than I need

as basic as a launcher would be with still a lot of features.
