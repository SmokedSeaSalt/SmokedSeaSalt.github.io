This website is build using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and using the [Chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) which has a great [getting started page](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/).

It has some great plugins built in like [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) to create graphs, flowcharts and git diagrams.

for xy graphs some options are:
  - [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/line/interpolation.html)
  - [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/)
  - [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart)

[A good example of a chirpy theme](https://www.ataidev.cc/). There are some tutorials on how to do the setup for their CSS theme but it is in Korean.


[Terminal to interactive svg](https://blog.epheme.re/software/termtosvg.html)
Awesome tool to record terminal activity and embed it as an SVG on a website.
This makes even the text in the frame copy-able.

## List description

A more elaborate description for all the todo list items.

### Theory

In general the theory pages will be summaries of varied programming theories that are useful to know. I like creating my own explanations for things to better teach people and for me to understand.

#### Big O notation

I have always known what the big O notation meant, but wanted a clear visualisation with graph, code, example times and explanation in 0 place.

#### Linked lists

how do they work. how to use them, WHY and WHEN to use them.

#### Language specific syntaxing

How and why does the struct syntaxing work for C.
how and why does the typedef syntaxing work for C.
What is de difference between ++i or i++.
char *str or char str[].
difference between str++ and str[i].

### Projects

This will be pages dedicated to projects I did or am doing.

#### Shortcut Keypad

I made a shortcut keypad for fun. But wanted to document some design choices/finding to remind myself later when i finally finish this project.

### CODAM

This page will be filled with thing specifically related to CODAM.

### Learning/Documentation

Collection of interesting documents/websites/project/topics found on the internet to explore later.

### Fun collection

Collection of fun documents/websites/project/topics found on the internet to explore later.

### Complete this site

fill the page. who i am, why i did certain things, how i did certain things.

Get things the way I want, more unique.
