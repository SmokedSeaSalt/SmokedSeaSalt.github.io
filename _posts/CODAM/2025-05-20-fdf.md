## FdF
This will just be a thought collection or code snippet storage. Not a detailed walkthrough or example of FdF.

This project involves creating a simple wireframe model of a landscape.

## Overview
This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges).

## Rendering
Your program has to represent the model in isometric projection. The coordinates of the landscape are stored in a .fdf file, provided as a command line parameter to your program. Here is an example:

```text
$>cat 42.fdf
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0 10 10  0  0 10 10  0  0  0 10 10 10 10 10  0  0  0
0  0 10 10  0  0 10 10  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 10 10  0  0
0  0 10 10  0  0 10 10  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 10 10  0  0
0  0 10 10 10 10 10 10  0  0  0  0 10 10 10 10  0  0  0
0  0  0 10 10 10 10 10  0  0  0 10 10  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0 10 10  0  0  0 10 10  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0 10 10  0  0  0 10 10 10 10 10 10  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
$>
```

this should result in something like this:
![FdF example](/assets/img/fdf/FdF_example.png){: w="900" h="720" }

## Graphic management

Your program has to display the image in a window.
- Window management must remain smooth (e.g., switching to another window, minimizing, etc.).
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- Clicking on the cross on the windowâ€™s frame must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- The use of the images of the MiniLibX library is mandatory

## Map parsing
![FdF example](/assets/img/fdf/FdF_map_parsing.svg){: .w-50 .right}
For the map parsing a file with all height and colour data needs to be parsed. I've done this in multiple steps.
1. Read the entire map into `char *file_buffer`.
2. Split `char *filebuffer` into `char **line_array` by splitting on the `\n` character.
3. Split `char **line_array` into `char ***char_array` by splitting on the spaces. This will create a 2d string array with a string for each map coordinate.
4. Create a 2d struct array `t_coord **pix_array` according to the dimensions of `char ***char_array`.
5. fill in the height and colour in the `t_coord **pix_array` according to the content of `char ***char_array`.

## Math
### Rotating
The following [Rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#In_three_dimensions) is applied to the point cloud created to rotate the points around the corresponding axis. After this a translated point-map is made and passed on to draw lines in between these points.

$$
{\displaystyle {\begin{alignedat}{1}R_{x}(\theta )&={\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\[3pt]0&\sin \theta &\cos \theta \\[3pt]\end{bmatrix}}\\[6pt]R_{y}(\theta )&={\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &0&\sin \theta \\[3pt]0&1&0\\[3pt]-\sin \theta &0&\cos \theta \\\end{bmatrix}}\\[6pt]R_{z}(\theta )&={\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &-\sin \theta &0\\[3pt]\sin \theta &\cos \theta &0\\[3pt]0&0&1\\\end{bmatrix}}\end{alignedat}}}
$$

### Drawing lines
[Bresenham's line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm) is used for the calculation do draw pixels on a line. This is a expansion on the basic `y=mx+b` formula.
